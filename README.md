## Background
This project was made for an English class to showcase "my identity." Students were given the option of designing a tri-fold poster board, writing a song, or anything their heart desired, so I made a video game. Please enjoy this small mario-esque game created from scratch using Javascript and the HTML Canvas element (I also drew all the images myself if you couldn't tell).

## Game Mechanics
Use the left and right arrow keys to run, the up arrow to jump (or swim upwards), and the down arrow to ground-pound on mystery boxes. To advance to the next level, you must reach the right side of the screen, hitting mystery boxes along the way. Each mystery box displays an image with a link you can click on! Falling off the map will respawn you at the left side of the screen.

If you find a ladder, climb up it. If you're in the ocean, make your way to the pipe, stopping at each mystery box along the way.

**Please note:** many aspects of the contents project will seem strange without the context of the English assignment, but you can still enjoy the many gameplay features I labored over.
